				<p> Hi! I'm Lizz and this is my web page where you will pretty much find anything you wish to know about me. Everything you see here was coded and built by me! My mother is Russian and my father is Egyptian, so as you can imagine, I live in a very culturally diverse household! I am a competetive figure skater with an olympic dream and when I am not on the ice I am either being a complete Latin nerd or playing with my kitty Louis Vuitton! </p>
